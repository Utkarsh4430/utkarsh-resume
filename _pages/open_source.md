### **Occluded Facial Expression Recognition**

- The technique rendered an average gain of 3.90% over the baseline for 3 standard benchmarking datasets

### **ANN-GWO Intrusion Detection System**
- Developed a hybrid IDS by using Grey Wolf Algorithm instead of backpropagation with artificial neural networks
- Utilized MIT Darpa 1998 dataset and achieved SOTA results
