I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing (Speech and Text). I have a special focus on multimodal learning with a goal of advancing representation learning. Currently I am also working on text-to-speech models for low resource indic languages. In the modality of text, I like working on the topics of content moderation and information extraction. I am currently focused on making deep learning models for detecting complex entities in text and help detect implicit hate speech in online conversations.

I am excited to see what multiple modalities together can offer (speech, text and graphs).

<!-- P.S. : Though I acknowledge that achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results is not and should not be the final goal of research, I am proud that some of my works achieve SOTA on some well known Speech and Language Processing task (until November 2022).
