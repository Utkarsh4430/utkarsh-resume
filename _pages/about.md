My name is Utkarsh Tyagi. I am currently an M.S. in C.S. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. At UMCP, I work under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) on various problems in speech and audio processing. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer II at [Atlassian, India](https://www.atlassian.com/). Beyond Software Engineering, I am interested in Speech and Language Processing. I am working as a part time researcher at [MIDAS Labs @ IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn). Here, I worked on problems like disfluency detection in speech and complex named entity recognition.

Previously I have interned in the Voice Intelligence team at [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). Here I worked on improving Bixbyâ€™s wakeup word detection and built a  vocabulary-independent, lightweight keyword spotter. I have also worked as a research intern at the [Samsung Innovation Lab, DTU](https://sites.google.com/view/sdarldtu/home?authuser=1&pli=1). Here, I developed an AI-powered mobile camera-based application to calculate sustained attention span using a candle flame test.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at [Delhi Technological University](https://www.dtu.ac.in/) in 2021. I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. I am always open to collaborations and please feel free to drop a mail!
